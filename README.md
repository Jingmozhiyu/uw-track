## Update Logs

### 4/1/2026
This project was refactored across many aspects.

In short, it was updated from a basic monitor into a more production-oriented system with better structure, observability, safety, and deployment readiness.

Main changes:
- Reworked the data model from the old task-centric structure to `users`, `courses`, `course_sections`, and `user_section_subscriptions`
- Changed polling from per-user fetching to course-level deduplicated crawling
- Added dynamic polling with `nextPollAt` and a queue-based fixed-rate scheduler
- Introduced RabbitMQ for asynchronous email delivery and dead-letter handling
- Added Redis-backed rate limiting, search miss caching, and daily mail counters
- Split user APIs and admin APIs more clearly
- Added admin monitoring endpoints for subscriptions, dead letters, mail deliveries, mail stats, and scheduler status
- Completed Docker Compose + Caddy deployment files so the project is close to plug-and-play on a VM

## Deployment

The repository already includes the required deployment files:
- `.env.example`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `Caddyfile`

### 1. Edit environment values

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, then fill in your real values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

- `MAIL_ADDRESS`
- `MAIL_AUTH_CODE`
- `DB_PASSWORD`
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `ADMIN_EMAIL`
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- `RABBITMQ_USERNAME`
- `RABBITMQ_PASSWORD`
- `TERM_ID`

If needed, also adjust:
- `RABBITMQ_HOST`
- `RABBITMQ_PORT`
- `REDIS_HOST`
- `REDIS_PORT`

### 2. Check the domain

Edit `Caddyfile` and replace the domain if needed:

```caddy
madenroll.duckdns.org {
    reverse_proxy app:8080
}
```

### 3. Build the jar

```bash
sh mvnw clean package -DskipTests
cp target/CourseMonitor-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar
```

### 4. Start the full stack

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 5. Check service status

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f app
```

### 6. Open the app

After the containers are healthy, open your configured domain in the browser.

## Notes

- The production stack includes MySQL, RabbitMQ, Redis, the Spring Boot app, and Caddy.
- The app container runs with the `prod` profile.
- If `docker compose up -d` fails locally with a Docker daemon error, start Docker Desktop (or your Docker engine) first.
